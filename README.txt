This project is a **work in progress** and is based on the fantastic open source work of the Jellyfin community and many other contributors. Huge thanks to everyone who has made Jellyfin possible!

**What is this?**

**Current Focus:**
- New themes (like the "Amber" theme)
- Improved navigation with icons
- Making the app more visually appealing and user-friendly
